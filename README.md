# **Basic Client Examples to demonstrate Broadcast Calls using Enablex Voice APIs. **
This example contains instructions how users can initiate Broadcast Calls.

## Prerequisite
- You will need Enablex Application credentials, APP ID and APP KEY.
- You will need a place for hosting this application either cloud or local machine.
- If hosting on local machine, you need to install ngrok from https://ngrok.com/


## Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/EnableX/voice-api-broadcast.git`
- `cd voice-api-broadcast`
- `npm install`

## Setting up configurations using environment variables
- Set APP ID and APP KEY. It is required configuration.
  - `export ENABLEX_APP_ID=`
  - `export ENABLEX_APP_KEY=`

- Set port. Default port is set to 3000. It is an optional configuration.
  - `export SERVICE_PORT=`

## Webhook - EnableX will send HTTP requests to your application (`/event`) after certain events occur.
- If you have deployed this service on a web server which is publicly accessible, set the public URL. Example - `https://{PUBLIC_URL}`
  - `export PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=`
- If you want to test this service on a web server running locally on your own computer at a given port, with ngrok, you can generate URL that tunnels requests to your web server running locally. Once ngrok installed, run following -
  - `./ngrok http {SERVICE_PORT}` . It should provide you a ngrok URL something similar to `https://fc6c892d6cd7.ngrok.io`. Now, Set the ngrok URL. Example - `https://fc6c892d6cd7.ngrok.io`
    - `export PUBLIC_WEBHOOK_URL=`

## Webhook security
- Webhook security is also implemented as part of the voice service APIs.
- Enablex Voice Server does encryption of Webhook payload using 'md5' encryption and app_id as key.
- Client needs to do decryption of payload using app_id provided by Enablex and algorithm, format, encoding parameters present in x-algoritm, x-format and x-encoding header.
- Please refer to the documentation and examples for proper way of handling Webhook payloads.

## Starting the client application script
- For Broadcast Calls
  - `node client-broadcast.js`
